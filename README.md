Features

Gnome-shell extension for improving application switching on multi-monitor setups.

The main feature is modifying alt-tab so it only cycles through the windows on the active monitor.

Updated and tested to work with gnome 3.30.1

Temporary install instructions
==

Open `lg (alt + f2 -> 'lg')` and copypaste the file `alt-tab-monitor.js`

TODO
==

- Complete/improve the feature section of this readme
- Turn this into a proper gnome-shell extension
